Wordpress plugin for integration with the Flexkids HUB. With this plugin you can link Caldera Forms to the Flexkids sales funnel.

== Description ==
With the Wordpress plugin from flexkids you can let your Wordpress website communicate with the flexkids environment via the hub:

* You can let web forms communicate directly with the Salesfunnel. Potential customers who fill in the web forms can be shot directly as a lead. You can build the web forms yourself if you have the Caldera plugin for Wordpress, but you can also use a number of demo web forms that we have created.
* You can show your childcare and childminder locations on your website on a map (Google Maps).

What do you need?

* A website made in Wordpress 5.1 (or higher)
* The scripting language PHP 7.2 (or higher) must be supported on the server of your web hosting provider
* A caching plugin for Wordpress (for example, W3 Total Cache)
* The Caldera Forms plugin (if you want to use web forms)
* The WP Google Map Pro plugin (if you want to show childcare and / or childminder locations on your website)
* Website integration data (you get this from our integration specialist)

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-flexkids` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings -> Flexkids screen to configure the plugin
